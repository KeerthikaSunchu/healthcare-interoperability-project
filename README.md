# Healthcare Interoperability Project

This repository contains the complete work for the **Healthcare Interoperability Project**, aimed at achieving seamless data exchange between healthcare systems. The project demonstrates interoperability principles, focusing on HL7 standards, CDA document transformations, and real-time API interactions.

---

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Enhance interoperability between healthcare systems (System A: OpenMRS, System B: Surescripts) by leveraging HL7 standards, CDA templates, XSLT transformations, and REST APIs.
- **Use Case**: A clinician diagnoses a patient and generates an electronic prescription, which is transmitted to a pharmacy network for dispensing.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Standards**: HL7 CDA, FHIR, NCPDP SCRIPT
- **Terminologies**: ICD-10-CM, SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, LOINC
- **Tools**:
  - **Oxygen XML Editor**: Used to create and validate CDA documents and XSLT transformations.
  - **Postman**: Used for API interactions to send and retrieve data between systems.
- **Languages**: XML, XSLT, JSON

## Sprints and Deliverables

### 1. **Use Case Selection and Details**
   - **File**: `part-1-use-case-selection-clinician-to-pharmacy.pdf`
   - **Summary**: Defined the clinician-to-pharmacy use case, identified clinical concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medication), and mapped them to terminologies like ICD-10-CM, SNOMED-CT, and RxNorm.

### 2. **Problem Analysis and Modeling**
   - **File**: `part-2-problem-analysis-modeling-electronic-prescription.pdf`
   - **Summary**: Developed UML and BPMN models to represent semantic and syntactic interoperability between clinicians, EHRs, and pharmacies. Focused on the e-prescription workflow.

### 3. **CDA Entry Mockups**
   - **Folder**: `part-3-cda-entry-mockups`
   - **Files**:
     - `annotated-complete-cda.xml`
     - `cda-viewer-screenshot1.png`
     - `cda-viewer-screenshot2.png`
   - **Summary**: Created a customized CDA document including sections like patient demographics, encounters, medications, and diagnoses. Validated the CDA document using Oxygen XML Editor and HL7 Viewer.

### 4. **Interoperability Pipeline**
   - **Folder**: `part-4-interoperability-pipeline`
   - **Files**:
     - `encounter-diagnosis-histories.xsl`
     - `medication-order-system-a.xsl`
     - `medication-order-system-b.xsl`
     - `medications-system-a.xsl`
     - `medications-system-b.xsl`
     - `patient-details-system-a.xsl`
     - `patient-details-system-b.xsl`
     - `vital-signs-physical-exam.xsl`
     - `final-customized-cda.xml`
     - `interoperability-pipeline-report.pdf`
   - **Summary**: Used XSLT transformations to extract and convert CDA data into formats required by System A (JSON) and System B (XML). Posted JSON data to OpenMRS and XML data to Surescripts, ensuring interoperability.

### 5. **Terminology Project Demo**
   - **Summary**: Demonstrated real-time data exchange:
     - **System A**: Posted JSON data to OpenMRS via REST API and verified updates in the UI.
     - **System B**: Transformed retrieved data into XML for Surescripts and validated receipt.
   - **Note**: No additional files were generated for this sprint as it focused on implementation and demonstration.

## How to Run
1. **View CDA Documents**:
   - Open `annotated-complete-cda.xml` using Oxygen XML Editor or any HL7 CDA Viewer.
   
2. **Test XSLT Transformations**:
   - Run the XSLTs in `part-4-interoperability-pipeline` using Oxygen XML Editor or any XSLT processor (e.g., Saxon).

3. **Post JSON Data**:
   - Use Postman to POST JSON payloads to OpenMRS.
   - Monitor System Aâ€™s UI for updates.

4. **Verify System B Integration**:
   - Transform JSON data into XML using XSLTs.
   - POST the XML to Surescripts and verify updates.
